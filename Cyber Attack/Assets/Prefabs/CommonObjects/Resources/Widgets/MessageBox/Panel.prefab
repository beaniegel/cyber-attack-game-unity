  m_Text: "Oh God, what have I done? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Bender, quit destroying
    the universe! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. One hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nYou mean
    while I'm sleeping in it? Anyone who laughs is a communist! Quite possible. We
    live long and are celebrated poopers. I just told you! You've killed me! We're
    rescuing ya.\r\n\r\nThen throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be
    referred to as \"the brig\". Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Yes. You gave
    me a dollar and some candy. But I've never been to the moon! The alien mothership
    is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall
    like a house of cards. Checkmate.\r\n\r\nAh, computer dating. It's like pimping,
    but you rarely have to use the phrase \"upside your head.\" When will that be?
    That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn
    to play this stupid thing.\r\n\r\nThen throw her in the laundry room, which will
    hereafter be referred to as \"the brig\". Noooooo! I wish! It's a nickel. Hey,
    guess what you're accessories to.\r\n\r\nYep, I remember. They came in last at
    the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! What are their names?
    No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Perhaps, but
    perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above
    you!\r\n\r\nI had more, but you go ahead. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to
    see! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH,
    FOR NO RAISEN! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth.
    Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those
    jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!\r\n\r\nNo,
    I'm Santa Claus! Shut up and get to the point! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye,
    cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some
    sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though
    they may be\u2026\r\n\r\nBender, quit destroying the universe! Hey, tell me something.
    You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
    I'm a thing. One hundred dollars. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable.
    I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.\r\n\r\nHey, what kinda party is this?
    There's no booze and only one hooker. She also liked to shut up! You guys realize
    you live in a sewer, right? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book
    'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance
    of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.\r\n\r\nShinier
    than yours, meatbag. I'm a thing. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody
    else's fault! Say what? A true inspiration for the children. I don't want to be
    rescued.\r\n\r\nYeah, I do that with my stupidness. We need rest. The spirit is
    willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I can explain. It's very valuable.
    If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    you have a dime up your nose. Then we'll go with that data file! Who's brave enough
    to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Uh, is the puppy mechanical
    in any way? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety.
    You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel
    angry!\r\n\r\nOh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I don't 'need' to drink.
    I can quit anytime I want! Also Zoidberg. Actually, that's still true.\r\n\r\nI
    decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which
    I just made up. Uhh\u2026 also, comes with double prize money. Hey, tell me something.
    You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?\r\n\r\nBite
    my shiny metal ass. I had more, but you go ahead. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
    Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people
    won't be sure you've done anything at all.\r\n\r\nVen ve voke up, ve had zese
    wodies. It's a T. It goes \"tuh\". You guys go on without me! I'm going to go\u2026
    look for more stuff to steal! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!\r\n\r\nThis
    is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Now what? Why did you
    bring us here? It's toe-tappingly tragic! It doesn't look so shiny to me.\r\n\r\nOk,
    we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper
    cars. Shut up and get to the point! I saw you with those two \"ladies of the evening\"
    at Elzars. Explain that. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a
    couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.\r\n\r\nI meant 'physically'.
    Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors
    or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Who are you, my warranty?! I can explain.
    It's very valuable."
